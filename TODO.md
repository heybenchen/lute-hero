# Lute Hero — TODO

## High Priority

- [ ] Rework `undergroundSceneProgress` — was gated on defeating elite monsters, needs a new trigger condition

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Verify boardSlice spawning integration — `spawnMonstersFromTags` behavior changed under same API, needs E2E validation

## Low Priority

- [x] Update notification hook — changed from blocking MessageBox to two-tone beep

## Completed

- [x] Remove elite monsters & rework spawning (types, data, spawner, calculator, UI, tests)

## Wishlist

- [ ] Add concept of studio level that affects what EXP cost of dice are shown
      in the store. Level 1 should prioritize cheap dice sets.
