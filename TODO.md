- Cascading crits: rolling max value on a die now rolls an additional die of the same type (can cascade repeatedly); replaces flat +4 crit bonus; removed redundant "explosive" track effect
- Players start with 3 untitled songs (first has 2 dice, others empty); buy "names" to grant effects instead of buying songs
